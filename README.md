PicLabel
========

Add labels to your pictures.

This Android app allows you to add a label at the top of your picture with the date
and location at which it was taken.

The date and location are retrieved from the EXIF tags of the picture (if not present, the current date and location are used.)

A choice of a few fonts is available.
